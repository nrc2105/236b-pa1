This program reads in a CSV of user ratings on movies and sets up methods to 
rank movies and compare users.  In this configuration, the movie_data_test.rb
file is used to test the functionality of movie_data.rb, as well as all
of the classes used by MovieData.  Data files are supplied through the
first command line argument.  

Any questions can be directed to Nicholas Cummins at ncummins@brandeis.edu
